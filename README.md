## The Effect of Establishment Size on Work Place Accidents
This repository contains the report, reproducibility package and working folder for the researcg paper "The Effect of Establishment Size on Work Place Accidents by Anna Rupert, Tomoyoshi Takita, Will Waghor, Yuhan Wang, students from Syracuse University. 

### Abstract
This research investigates the impact of establishment size on workplace safety, specifically examining the correlation between establishment size and the rate of injuries. Motivated by the role of workplace safety in employee well-being and business success, our study employs data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to explore this relationship. The theoretical foundation suggests that larger establishments may experience fewer injuries per worker due to potential economies of scale in OSHA inspections and safety practice implementation costs. Preliminary findings indicate a weak or non-existent correlation. This paper contributes valuable insights to the discourse on workplace safety dynamics.
