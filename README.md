This repository contains the report, reproducibility package and working folder for the researcg paper "The Effect of Establishment Size on Work Place Accidents by Anna Rupert, Tomoyoshi Takita, Will Waghor, Yuhan Wang, students from Syracuse University. 

### Abstract
Does establishment size impact worksite accident rates? To answer the question, we hypothesize that larger establishments will experience fewer injuries per worker than smaller establishments, as larger establishments will be more subject to economies of scale in terms of inspections and costs for safety regulations. In the research, we studied the data from OSHA about each establishment and its size, the total number of different illnesses, total injuries, and total annual employees in 2022. The result does not prove our hypothesis due to the statistically weak correlations between the injury rate and deciles of employees.
