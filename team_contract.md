# Team Contract 9/20/23

## Team Goals For The Project
-	Complete the project successfully and on time as a group
-	Create a timeline to complete individual tasks within the project **24+ hrs in advance** in order to allow time to proofread
-	Tasks should be delegated according to the skills and capabilities of individual members with emphasis on having all members contribute equally to the project
-	Group members should be able to communicate openly to ask each other for help when they are having issues with working on the project

## Expectations
-	Work should be proofread by at least one other member before being turned in
-	At the start of every meeting we should create a timeline for at least the coming week to determine who’s responsible for tasks and what we’re doing
-	Members who are absent from class meetings should receive some sort of summary of what was discussed in class by the group with regards to the project
-	The group should remain focused on coursework during class and be able to perform work outside of class promptly and if necessary together
-	Group members should not be obligated to respond to communication made during other class time or when they’re reasonably expected to be asleep e.g after 11pm although it’s fine to work together after this time
-	The group should be able to call meetings with ¾ majority with required attendance with the stipulation that it must work with the schedule. Meetings must be called 24 hours ahead and must work with the schedules of all members
-	All members should be present when major decisions regarding the course of the project are being made in order to facilitate input
-	The distribution of tasks should be discussed with all members and any final decision should be made with consensus, but all members should have a roughly equal amount of work done
-	If there’s an issue with the quality of the work it should be addressed by reaching out to the relevant group members to discuss it

## Policies & Procedure
