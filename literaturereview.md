### How does the rate of workplace accidents relate to firm characteristics?
##### Some basic questions I have are, "How do mean and variance vary by firm size?", and "Are extreme outliers permanent or transitory?", essentially measuring the extent of mean reversion among the top percentiles of the distribution.

This literature review aims to resolve some of these questions, and help the research team formulate research hypothesis/hypotheses that are founded on economic theories.

**How I found this paper:** 
-  I used Professor Singletons research and found this as one of his sources. This seemed applicable to our out review assignment. 

**Big Picture Question:**  
- How do firms, households, and markets come together to determine the safety or health risk of a given workplace or good? 

**Hypothesis:** 
- There is evidence that households and firms come together to decide the safety of a job and the equivalent price associated with a job. Consumers and Workers equal compensation for this risk they are taking by working at a given workplace or using a good. 

**Theories that supported this hypothesis:**
-  Wages being dependent on the characteristics of the job. 
- Market prices for goods being dependent on their impact on consumers.
- Labor Markets (Law of Supply and Demand)

**Specific Question:** 
- How do labor and product markets pair prices and health risks and how does firm and government policy change post injuries or death?  Is there a way to increase safety without damaging profit? 

**Hypothesis:** 
- There is a substantial difficulty for workplaces to make health and safety improvement because of the finial impact it will have on the product price and the worker’s wages. However, there is a possibility that creating a safer workplace could allow wages to drop and increase profitability. 

**Theories that supported this hypothesis:** 
- Law of Supply and demand pertaining in this case to labor, if the price of one worker increases then the amount of workers demanded by a firm will decrease. 
- Government intervention in wages and workplace regulation.

**How I found this paper:** 
-  I used Professor Singletons research and found this as one of his sources. This seemed applicable to our lit review assignment. 

**Big Picture Question:** 
- How do random workplace inspections impact the frequency of workplace accidents? 

**Hypothesis:** 
- When there are random inspections of firms safety and health risks, there are less workplace accidents. 

**Theories that supported this hypothesis:** 
- The principle of firm competition and how it interacts with inspections. 
- Cost of creating a safe workplace and how it impacts profit. 

**Specific Question:** 
- How do random occupational and health inspections impact the safety of workers and the frequency of workplace accidents. In the long run, how can this help lower injury-related costs for firms? 

**Hypothesis:** 
- When there are random inspections of firms safety and health risks, there are less workplace accidents, which in turn allows for less injury related costs to firms, including lawsuits. 

**Theories that supported this hypothesis:** 
- Cost to Firms 
- Potentially, an increase in profit or wages long term.,

What affect dose labor unions have on workplace safety 

Labor unions are known to maintain safe workplaces and prevent hazards in worksite though collective voice and communication with management. Dose data on the amount of workplace accidents from union and non-union Workers support this idea?

How I found this paper. I found it online in the reference's professor Singleton used in his paper 

Big picture question: why dose the data show that there is no effect on unionization to accident case rates even though labor unions are known to make the workplace safer.  What are some factors that affect the Likely hood of a worker reporting a accident.

Hypothesis – the people not in labor unions might not be educated on how to report an accident in the workplace. And it is easier to report something if a worker is in a union because the worker will have a bigger voice and support.  

Theory - people in unions can report more accidents without backlash.
